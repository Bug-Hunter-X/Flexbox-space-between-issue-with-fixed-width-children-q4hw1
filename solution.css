A more robust approach uses `flex-grow` and a small margin to ensure consistent spacing:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > * {
  width: 100px;
  flex-grow: 1;
  margin: 0 10px; /* Adjust margin as needed */
}
```

This solution involves assigning a `flex-grow` property of 1 to each child. Then, `justify-content: space-between` evenly distributes the space between the items. To add a small margin (10px in this case), this code avoids overlapping elements. Adjust the margin as needed.
