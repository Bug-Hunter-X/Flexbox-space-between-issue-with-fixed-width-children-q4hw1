The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > * {
  width: 100px;
}
```

The intention is to have three 100px wide items evenly spaced within a flex container.  However, depending on the browser and the total width, the items might not be evenly spaced or might overlap due to the calculation of space between.
